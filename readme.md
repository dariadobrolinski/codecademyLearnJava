# Codecademy Java Learning Projects

This repository contains my work as I progress through the [Codecademy Learn Java course](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/learn-java). It includes various mini projects and exercises that I complete as part of the curriculum. Each project is designed to help reinforce key Java programming concepts and build practical coding skills.

As I advance through the course, I will continue to add new projects and code samples to this repository. This is a personal learning journey, and the code here reflects my growth and understanding of Java.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my progress!
